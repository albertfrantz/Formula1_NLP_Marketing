Bookending these drivers are the rookies of 1970 and 1973.

1970 rookies Bill Dennis, Joe Frasson, Jim Vandiver, and Tamladge Prince (who showed promise but was sadly killed in his 2nd race) combined for **15** top fives, **64** top tens, and **2** lead lap finishes.

1973 had 2 rookies who would win races in Lennie Pond and Darrell Waltrip, ending a 3-year streak of rookies who would never win a race in their career (1969 introduced Dick Brooks).

As an engineering student, its tough, very tough, and I barely have time to wipe my own ass and only work 12 hours a week to be able to keep up with my studies. Then I see Ryan Newman who was working on his racing career as well as at his Dad's auto shop and was an engineering student all at the same time.

NASCAR,"Recently, it's been announced that Tony Stewart is creating the SRX All-Stars series. It's a 6 race series at short tracks featuring the best drivers in the U.S. at those sorts of tracks. It's modeled after the old IROC series. However, I don't have that good feelings about IROC from what I've heard.

In theory, IROC is a great idea. Having drivers from different disciplines of auto racing compete to see who is the best in the world in identical cars sounds amazing. However, reality wasn't quite that simple. For starters, the cars were full-body stock cars which put open-wheeled drivers at a disadvantage. Then there were the tracks. There was some diversity in tracks in the 70s and 80s but the last non-NASCAR used track was Burke-Lakefront Airport in 1990 while the last non-oval track was Watkins Glen in 1991. This put sports car drivers at a disadvantage. As a result, NASCAR drivers dominated IROC winning every championship from 1988 until the organization closed up shop after 2006. Since this is the NASCAR subreddit, you readers may like this fact but I feel that drivers from other leagues shouldn't be at that much of a disadvantage. It just doesn't seem fair.

I have a proposition to resurrect IROC. However, my plan would be a bit different. For starters, I think IROC was supposed to be the Olympics of Auto Racing. Well, how about we hold it every four years to make it more special. Similar to the NHL having an Olympics break, various racing series would need an IROC break since it would all happen in about two week. I would want this event to start in 2023. We'd have four races each with two different types of cars. There would be two oval and two road course races. As for the cars, they would be kit cars of open-wheeled and full-bodied cars. Each type of car would have one oval and one road course race.

There's one other detail to note. All the races would either take place in one country or one region of the United States. This would minimize travel costs once IROC has begun. Here's a sample of what that could look like by using Florida as an example.

April 2, 2023: New Smyrna Speedway (Full-Bodied)

April 16, 2023: Sebring International Raceway (Open-Wheeled)

April 23, 2023: Daytona Roval (Full-Bodied)

April 30, 2023: Homestead-Miami Speedway (Open-Wheeled)

If you're wondering why I skipped April 9th, it's because that's when Easter occurs in 2023 and NASCAR traditionally takes Easter weekend off. I would like you to give your opinions on this idea. Could it be improved? Am I just out of my mind? Please let me know in the comments section.",Proposed IROC Resurrection

NASCAR,,Guys what and why is this?
NASCAR,"I came up with a very dangerous 3 mile ""super speedway"" which will and should never be built.

*Track Itself*

It's just a bunch of straight aways. There's 4 turns. There are  two 1.25 mile straight aways at the bottom and top, then another two quarter mile straight aways at the side. Not to bad right? on each corner there is a sudden by not yet dangerous banking, 35*. Pretty bad right? Well I have something even worse. I call it reverse banking. Its gonna bank outward instead of inward. Now it's literally terrifying, but I still can make it worse and absolutely horrible. NASCAR would probably not even race on it. we take the turn, And we gradually bend it down to where the top of the banked part is in line with the straight aways. Then he comes back up and flushes with the track. Pit road will be vertically connecting turn 1 to turn 2 when they come flush.

*Track Safety*

So obviously we have to have a runoff with the inverse banking. So we build a huge patch of whatever runoff material they would feel safe using. And place the track dead center. As dangerous as it sounds, no catch fences. We have a run off on both sides of the track. So cars just skid onto the runoff. The only part that will have a catch fences is the inside in the turns. We need catch fences then. Of course this isn't a plate race. This doesn't need plates to be a crazy crashing race.

*Track Event*

I call it the all in all race. All 3 divisions will race at one time on one track. TWICE. Pocono double header style. It sounds terrible and insane. But team will be able to ""rent"" cup series cars for all racers. They break it they fix it. They total it they pay the track a little bit of money. This would be so expensive but it would be so exciting and give a chance for lower division drivers to show off they're skills. You could have Jimmy Johnson win it, or maybe Grant Enfinger, fans would love it regardless!

*Summary*

This is not an argument, nor an offial track plan. It's a terrifying track I thought of in my sleep. Despite the way I tried to justify things, this isn't an argument for it either. I just thought it would be fun to see what y'all think. Let me know, Jimmy Johnson for 2020 champion!",Horrible track idea.

NASCAR,"Going primarily off of average finish so far this year Ryan has an average finish of 13.8, second only to Carl Edwards' 13.8 since 2013. To say Ryan is the most improved driver of 2019 would be only arguable with William Byron imo. He's taken a team that had an average finish of ~22nd with Bayne in the ride, to being in solid playoff contention. 

Speaking of which in Newman's runner up title year his average finish was 12.7, not far off where he's at now. In the playoffs that year he had an average finish of 9th.

Newman's best tracks historically are Darlington on Sept. 1st, Indianapolis the week after, and Richmond in the first round. Talledega in the second round is a crapshoot but he's finished outside of the top ten only twice in the past five races, and in the third round he's shown himself capable over the past few seasons at ISM even without putting all your chips on his fuel strategy win. He didn't run too bad at the Roval last year either finishing 11th.

NASCAR,"Hey guys - long time lurker here. I am a high school social studies instructor that teaches an elective class that explores U.S. history through the lens of sports. I try to use a variety of different sports to instruct my students including auto racing (especially regarding prohibition and the bootlegging era). Often, other sports lend themselves to our discussions more than racing - but I would like to expose my students to more NASCAR. Recently, we began utilizing virtual learning experiences to supplement our content. We are a rural school with limited funds ‚Äì virtual learning has allowed me to give my students access to opportunities that would otherwise be impossible. We have conducted live chats with the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the National Archives. We utilize platforms like ZOOM conferencing to accomplish these interactions. I just wanted to reach out to the NASCAR community (teams, tracks, drivers, crew, anyone really) to see if anyone would be willing to work with us to create one of these experiences. I am not looking for a major time commitment ‚Äì a short virtual conference of 5 minutes would do wonders to peak students‚Äô interests (and can take place from anywhere). These short chats can be accomplished with nothing more than a cell phone and the ZOOM app (or a laptop with a speaker and camera). These chats could be no more than just explaining what you do in the sport ‚Äì I am just hoping to build interest (in both racing and school). I know that the majority of the NASCAR community is¬†dedicated to promoting and growing the sport - if anyone would like to help do this with high school students, we would love to communicate with you.

It was really neat to watch a race here before the ""end"", when it was just another short track race on the schedule. A few things stood out to me:

* Waltrip and Junior Johnson were money on short tracks, Wilkes was a home game for Junior. Even Neil Bonnett's Johnson #12 was great.
* There were only 30 starters.
* Ricky Rudd and Dale Earnhardt had swapped rides that year, but both were still blue and yellow Wrangler.
* The racing groove was higher in turns 1/2 than I'd have assumed. Wonder if this has to do with the track being on a hill and 1/2 and 3/4 being different elevations?
* The backdrop of the track was very scenic with the hills and greenery of a beautiful fall day. This was before the back stretch grandstands.

\- Comers and goers were real. Carl Edwards was charging through the field and took the lead after about 20 laps and seemed to be pulling away, then the next time I checked about lap 50, he had dropped all the way back to 5th.

NASCAR,"How will NASCAR‚Äôs new sponsorship model affect monster energy and the sport as a whole?   
   
I think Monster Energy has done a great job getting more younger fans in the sport, the fan zones they have at the race tracks and the all-star intros they have are amazing and the Monster Girls are also amazing.   
    
With NASCAR‚Äôs new sponsorship model will Monster Energy still be just as involved in the sport? I think it‚Äôs very important that they are because they can bring even more younger fans into the sport.    
     
I‚Äôm just a little worried about this new sponsorship model there doing, I‚Äôm hoping Monster Energy still has some role in the sport next year.",NASCAR‚Äôs new sponsorship model that starts next year

NASCAR,"So gen 7 shouldn't be far away from being revealed to the public so I guess now appropriate now to discuss possible features of it.
Personally the biggest thing for me is hopefull removal of side force which should help with racing plus the removal of splitter. Next big thing is cost, which should be a significant portion smaller then curent one. 
But also the biggest wory with it is that NASCAR wants to continue to use the current ""drafting package"" aka 550 hp and high downforce which isn't such a great news. The biggest issue with it is that it makes driver skill seem optional and it puts more focus is put on the car which shouldn't be a case in sport that prevoiusly focused it self on driver skill.",How much are you looking forward to Gen 7

&amp;#x200B;

The first is Jack Roush. My friend and I were casually waiting between pit road and the garages. We noticed Jack just moseying around. I was surprised people weren't really going up to him. I remember him taking a rather long time to sign and he was shakey. We talked for a little bit with him, thanking him for his time.   


Joey Logano is the second one on the front. This one was actually an after thought for myself. I had a chance earlier in the day to get him to sign (My friend followed him all the way down to pit road and almost got his pass taken to get his signature). But after getting Jimmies autograph I thought ""Heck why not"". I caught him as he came out of the garage, talked and walked with him wishing him good luck (he ended up sweeping the weekend, haha). 

&amp;#x200B;

Chad Knaus (on the back) I seen him walking by and asked my friend if that was Chad (he is terrible at spotting people). I hollered ""Hey chad, have a sec to sign my ticket"" and he said yep if you can catch up to me. Meanwhile my 250lb self strutted over to him swiftly lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmie Johnson. I've loved watching Jimmie since I was a little kid. I actually started following him because he represented Lowes not because he won a bunch of races (I became a fan of his in 2004). When I watched a ton of other drivers pour into the garages for sprint cup practice I seen a real nice covered black cart come up, then Jimmie popped out quicker than I could get to him, or anybody else for that matter. So I waited right next to that black golf cart. The only way he was getting on is if he at least acknowledged me and said Hi lol. He snuck behind the trailers to avoid the overwhelming crowd of fans chasing him (honestly makes a lot of sense). I seen him pop out while nobody else did. I stood there and asked him to sign my ticket and he did his little loops. All I remember when he was signing is staring at his belt for some reason lol. I felt like a little kid, getting my driving idols autograph. I was shaking.   


My didn't get Jimmie but he got Danica, Boris Said, Joey and Jack. Not bad in my honest opinion.   


I know in 2016 I seen Greg Biffle just chilling between two trailers in the infield casually and I got him to sign my brothers ticket. My brother was rather excited

NASCAR,"Basically everything I'd do if I controlled NASCAR

Rule changes:

* 2018 aero rules but no tapered spacers

* no more stages

* no overtime

* no playoffs

* no competition cautions

* no charters or provisionals, top 40 make the field

* completely new qualifying format: Single-car qualifying, each car gets 3 laps (2 on tracks 2 miles or longer and road courses) and only their fastest lap counts, no second round, top 40 make the field no matter what (except for Daytona 500)

* Daytona 500 qualifying: just like normal, the top 2 in qualifying start first and second, and the Duels are the same, and top 19 not already on the front row fill out spots 3-40.

* no more points for duels

* weekend format: 1 hour practice on Saturday morning, qualifying Saturday afternoon, Race Sunday. If the race is on Saturday, practice and qualifying on Friday.  Parc ferme starts 90 minutes after qualifying.

* on road courses, teams have to change to wets under green, like in F1. If a caution comes out for an incident, teams may put wets on then. 

* Points: See table below, but cars must complete 80% of the race distance to score points, but there are 4 3-point bonuses available, for pole position, leading a lap, leading the most laps, and the fastest lap. Cars have to finish 80% of the race to get these points as well. Anyways, points are: 

|Pos|Points|Pos|Points|Pos|Points|Pos|Points|

Yes, it's only 32 races.",What I would do if I was in charge of nascar
NASCAR,"I have two questions that I can't figure out. I am new to NASCAR and I'm watching on the Daytona 500 from 2009 on YouTube. My first question is, they set a competition caution for lap 25, but almirola wrecked on lap 8. Due to this, most of the cars pitted. why have a competition caution at lap 25 if you could already bring people in for a wreck prior to the caution is my first question.

my second question is that in other races I have seen, with these competition cautions, they don't force everyone to come in. It is my feeling that if they are going to have a competition caution, everyone should have to pit to check their tire wear. Why have a competition caution, and then let car stay on the track? If they are not forced to come in, then why bother having the caution flag? 

Just trying to get my head around the point.
Thank you in advance.",New to the sport and confused.
NASCAR,,RFR will change their name for 2019 season.
NASCAR,"When looking at the ‚Äúdecline‚Äù for NASCAR, many people point to changes made to the series point standings, to cars, and to the races themselves. However, when I look at NASCAR I see a sport with an identity crisis, a sport trying to appeal to everyone but failing to reach anyone. I see a sport whose system discourages fans from buying merchandise, and fails to keep fans when drivers retire. The problems in NASCAR are not due to gimmicks, nor the economy, but due to bad design and marketing.


When you look at the way NASCAR markets itself, it is easy to see the lack of identity. It wants to be on the cutting edge of technology, but constantly looking at its past. It tries to use country artists and iconography to market to a nationwide audience. The first step to healing the design issues in NASCAR would be to unify this image. If the sport wants to be a bunch of good ol‚Äô boys, that works for a segment of the population. Same if it wants to cast a broad net and appeal to the average person. The sport needs to focus on one marketable aspect and hammer it in over a few years, to build that brand recognition and regain an identity.


The next step in this process would let the fans invest in the sport, with an eye towards long term loyalty. There is nothing worse than when your favorite driver moves teams, forcing their fans to buy new gear. If you were a Kurt Busch fan, you could have gear with the numbers 97, 2, 22, 51, 78, 41 and now 1 kicking around your house. It‚Äôs even worse if you‚Äôre a Chase Elliott fan, and your driver randomly renumbered from 24 to 9. The solution to this would be to assign the numbers to the driver. This would enable fans to buy a piece of a driver‚Äôs gear without fear of the driver moving teams. It would empower the drivers as well, giving them more rights with merchandising, and letting them sell stuff with their number. Teams of a certain age could save one marquee number (Petty 43, Wood 21, Childress 3, etc..), as well as the number 1 being reserved for the defending champion, but drivers would have much more power in the process and it would benefit the fans.


I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt this kill any kind of team identity?‚Äù The answer is no. Teams would be assigned a specific color for their numbers, to help fans quickly identify the team of a car. The spoilers and splitters would be painted to match. Aside from this, more teams could utilize specific design elements (like the Penske scallops or Petty swoop) to set their team apart. Maybe even a Constructor‚Äôs Championship could be added to build a stronger relationship between teams and fans, and build loyalty to retain fans of retiring drivers.


What do you think? Does any of this make sense, or would it blow up in the sport‚Äôs face?
",Design in NASCAR
NASCAR,"I wanted to let everyone here know, I have created a new facebook group for reddit users to use to create opportunities to meetup with other reddit users for NASCAR races, viewing parties, and other forms of racing.  Currently the main event going on is for the Dover spring race.  But this is helpful for those fans that may not have a lot of friends or family that are fans that want to go to races, so this will create an opportunity to meet with like minded people.  This can be for going to a NASCAR race, a local track, or finding a mutual bar to meet with people to watch the race.  I will be more than happy to moderate to set up events upon request for specific races/requests. As of right now Dover's official reddit replied to the original [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/a8i945/reddit_doverpocono_gathering/) and said they may be willing to help out with something once the tickets are bought.

NASCAR,,"2016 NASCAR Season: Final ""F1 Style"" Points Standings"
NASCAR,"*Disclaimer:* This post is very long. 

*Disclaimer #2:* In this post I conclude that some drivers are bad, one of the greatest taboos of this website. 

In 2005, there were five cars at Roush, all of which made the playoffs. These were the #6 of Mark Martin, the #16 of Greg Biffle, the #17 of Matt Kenseth, the #97 of Kurt Busch, and the #99 of Carl Edwards. Together, these cars scored 15 wins, 71 top 5s, and 93 top 10s. All five of these cars were piloted by incontestably talented drivers at the time, and their results reflected that. 

So, what has changed since then? Was it a gradual decline in the quality of Roush‚Äôs equipment aided by a recessing economy that brought about the subsequent decline? Or was it the fault of the drivers that Roush hired during the time period that brought it about? It's probably a combination of the two; but there's an argument to be made that the fault lies primarily in the drivers‚Äô hands. To answer this question, let's investigate the role of the drivers in Roush‚Äôs rise, focusing on cars that weren‚Äôt the flagship #6. 

##16
The #16 team began its full-time schedule in 1992 with Wally Dallenbach, Jr., where it scavenged five top-10s in two years. The #16 car saw marginal improvement over the next few years with Ted Musgrave behind the wheel, but this trend declined with the hiring of Kevin Lepage to the wheel of the car. Lepage garnered 7 top 10s in roughly two and a half seasons before being released. 

Then, there was Greg Biffle. He finished an impressive 13th right off the bat in his 2002 debut and won the second Daytona race during his rookie year. He surpassed the number of top 10s the three drivers before him scored over nine full seasons in just more than three full seasons, and scored a whopping 11 wins in the process. Growth was steady as soon as Greg Biffle began piloting the car. 

##97
The #97 car made its first twelve starts in 1997 and ran full-time starting in 1998. Chad Little scored 10 top-10 finishes in 105 starts from 1997 to 2000, the final year of which he only started 27 races. 

Then, Kurt Busch came. In the 36 races of his second season in the 97 alone, Busch doubled the amount of top 10s the 97 had amassed in 105 races under Little, scoring four wins. Even if it took a rough rookie season to warm up, Busch changed everything for the #97 camp, just as Biffle would with the #16.

##17
Kenseth had already displayed a level of expertise in racing before the 17 team was established, finishing 6th in his 1998 debut for an ailing Bill Elliott Racing. He scored a top 5 for Jack Roush during one of his five starts in 1999, and then immediately began posting wins and double-digit top 10 totals during his subsequent rookie season. 

##99
Jeff Burton began driving the 99 car full-time in 1996 to immediate success, scoring 30 top 10s during his first two years. 

#Consensus
Roush‚Äôs rise was primarily brought about by the hiring of good drivers. That's why the 17 and the 99 never had to endure years of turmoil like the 16 and 97 had; they always had good drivers. Funding wasn't a factor, as all four of the cars had major sponsorship deals. Age of the teams wasn't a factor, as the 99 and 97 were created around the same time, but only the 99 had always been successful. Only two of the cars always had good drivers, and that's why only two of them always posted good results. 

So, can the opposite be said for Roush‚Äôs decline? Did Roush fall because of bad drivers? Let's look at the decline of different Roush cars and see for ourselves. 

##97 / #26
Kurt Busch posted an average of 18.25 top 10s per year from 2002 to 2005 before being released from Roush two races from the end of the year. Jamie McMurray replaced him for 2006, but posted a mere seven top 10s, less than half the amount of anyone else on the team. McMurray salvaged totals of only 9, 11, and 5 top-10 finishes over the next few years, while Biffle, Martin, Kenseth, and Edwards had successful seasons. It was a drastic change, and it occurred immediately when McMurray hopped in the car. 

After his miserable 2009 season, the team was sold off to Bill Jenkins, the first major downsizing of Roush Racing. It happened due to a lack of performance on the part of Jamie McMurray over the course of years, which jeopardized the 5-car team‚Äôs sustainability. It was the team‚Äôs only downsizing during the recession that is commonly implied to be the source of Roush‚Äôs downfall.

##6
Martin established himself as one of NASCAR‚Äôs all-time greats in the #6 machine, Jack Roush‚Äôs flagship ride. From the start of his modern career in 1988 until his last year with Roush in 2006, he only drove two seasons with fewer than 15 top-10s: 1988 and 2003. 

During David Ragan‚Äôs rookie year he scored 3 top-10s, but rebounded in 2008 with 14. While fewer than Martin scored nearly every year prior and inferior to the 27, 20 and 17 top-10s scored by his non-McMurray teammates, it was on-par with other successful Roush drivers‚Äô early years.  

2009 was a consistently difficult year for all Roush drivers, but there was still a clear difference in performance between Biffle, Kenseth and Edwards in comparison to Ragan and McMurray. Ragan finished 2 races in the top 10 as opposed to his teammates who comparatively netted 12, 14, and 16 top 10s. After the peak of the recession, the lack of performance continued for Ragan; he would only score 13 top 10s from 2009-12, leading to the #6 team‚Äôs absence from Cup for the next three years. 

##99 / #6
The #99 had tough years in 2009 and 2010, but like the #17, rebounded to finish second in the 2011 championship. He scored 4 wins and 30 top 10s during his final two years, after which the #99 crew moved to the #6 car fielded by Trevor Bayne. 

Bayne is grouped as the successor to Edwards only by a loose technicality. Nonetheless, Bayne has only finished in the top ten 11 times in 83 starts to date, three fewer than Edwards during 2014. Again, the change was not gradual. It was a direct result of Bayne taking over the #6 car. 

##17
Not only is this perhaps the greatest exemplification of this argument, it‚Äôs where its primary counterpoint - the economy - falls apart. Kenseth had a relatively ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù 2009, scoring a measly 12 top-10s. However, Kenseth‚Äôs performance was among the best in the field every year thereafter until his departure. He scored 15 top-10s in 2010, 20 in 2011, and 19 in 2012, amassing 6 total wins and never finishing outside the top 10 in points. If the recession destroyed Roush, it would‚Äôve slowly killed its performance over time. But it wasn‚Äôt time that set the boundary between each team‚Äôs rise and the onset of its downfall, it was the drivers that clearly marked the beginnings and ends of eras, every time. 

Ricky Stenhouse assumed the ride in 2013. His two teammates scored 29 top-10s and won 3 races between them, but Stenhouse could only rack up a trio of top 10s by year‚Äôs end. Over the next four years he added 14 top-10s to his name, as many as Carl Edwards did during his final year at Roush in 2014, and he also managed to become perhaps one of the most major drivers to DNQ in the Chase era. 

What else could explain such a drastic contrast in performance in two consecutive periods if not for the new driver? Did the equipment suddenly get bad? If so, did that magically happen every other time Roush put a different driver in their car? And why hadn‚Äôt it happened to Biffle and Edwards, who were still successful? It wouldn‚Äôt make sense otherwise. 

Stenhouse improved his performance in 2017, but has only managed 2 top 10s in 12 starts thus far in 2018. 

##16
Roush‚Äôs most recent casualty in the size department came as a result of Greg Biffle‚Äôs quiet 2016 departure from the series. Biffle scored an average of 15 top 10s per year from 2009 to 2014 before his performance fell in 2015 and 2016, where he scored only 7 total top 10s. Some things could have contributed to this, including aging or a lack of motivation from engineers at RFR, but regardless Biffle is the odd one out of this group. He is the only established good driver whose performance actually saw a gradual decline after the recession, although its onset was several years afterward.

#Conclusion
Of course there are more factors involved in a car‚Äôs performance than the raw talent of its driver. Jeff Burton had an illustrious career at Roush before gradually declining to a 6 top-10 season in 2004. After sponsors vacated the team he moved to Richard Childress Racing and consistently approached 20 top-10s per season shortly thereafter. While many things could possibly explain the 99‚Äôs lapse in performance, Jeff Burton being a subpar driver is not one of them. However, this does not negate the fact that drastic changes in stats for Roush‚Äôs individual teams almost always coincide with the firing and hiring of new drivers.

Now housed at post-apocalyptic Roush Fenway Racing are the slowly-improving Ricky Stenhouse and a mix of Matt Kenseth and Trevor Bayne swapping roles in the #6 car. So, when exactly did this apocalypse take place between the legendary 2005 season and now? 

The answer is, there wasn‚Äôt really an apocalypse. The only driver that gradually got worse towards the recent past was Greg Biffle. Sure, Burton got worse, but that was even before Roush hit its peak in the 2005 season. Roush didn‚Äôt die after the recession; its cars were still winning and scoring double-digit top 10 counts in 2014. However, those cars were being fielded by good drivers. Those that weren‚Äôt suffered, and nowadays all that‚Äôs left are the ones that aren‚Äôt, and thus there‚Äôs a whole lot of suffering at Roush. ",Was Roush‚Äôs decline brought about by bad drivers?

As someone trained to be a historian, it's really frustrating to see the amount of misinformation that gets circulated around the NASCAR community regarding anything that's happened in the history of the sport. Whether it be the constant 'Earnhardt wrecked everyone every race' stuff or the 'Petty's races weren't all Cup races' stuff, people seriously need to double-check stuff before they run their mouth.

If someone has multiple quality sources to back something up, it really doesn't matter what you've heard. It's wrong. That's just the way anything regarding history works. Just going off memory isn't enough, considering that memory is often considered to be one of the worst sources when it comes to history. Someone remembering stuff years later obviously isn't going to remember everything accurately. It's why most historians don't trust memoirs  written years after the fact.

NASCAR,"I believe NASCAR needs to completely overhaul its business model to be closer aligned with other major sports leagues. My ideas are a bit 'outside the box' and definitely hypothetical, but hear me out.. 

1. **NASCAR becomes solely responsible for obtaining primary sponsorship for each car** 
   1. NASCAR would have 40 sponsorship ""slots"" \- one for each entry in the field
   2. NASCAR is responsible for filling each sponsorship slot and, if unable to, then the slot is filled by a charity
   3. Each primary sponsorship would cost the exact same amount \- meaning each team would receive the same amount of money regardless of sponsor
   4. Sponsors could either be randomly placed on a team or through an internal selection process by NASCAR through business meetings with all participants
      1. \*\**I understand this is fantasy* and some sponsors are historically linked to teams so let's assume those sponsors will remain where they are
   5. NASCAR could provide better sponsor benefits such as more tv exposure, fan experiences, etc.. since they would be sponsoring the sport more so than an individual team
2. **NASCAR moves to a ""Franchise"" type model**
   1. The charter exists today for a reason, but I think it should be even more comprehensive. In this model a charter would be the key to obtaining one of the 40 sponsorship deals that NASCAR provides
   2. Each team owner would be required to field the same number of teams across the sport to level the playing field and even out the money distribution
   3. Revenue sharing would be equal among all teams for two years. After year two, revenue shares will be determined by final points position
   4. Internal team setup can be modified by each team with only a few exceptions: driver, crew chief, car chief, pit crews, head engineers, etc..
   5. Team owners could find their own secondary sponsorship to help increase overall revenue, but must be approved by NASCAR to avoid brand conflicts
3. **Completely overhaul the schedule**
   1. NASCAR needs to give the majority of fans what they want/like which is more short tracks, super speedways, and road courses. The 1.5 milers need to bite the dust, or at the very least have only one date on the schedule instead of two. 
   2. Reduce the number of miles/laps per race by 100 unless it is one of the marquee events such as the Daytona 500, Coke 600, Brickyard 400, and Southern 500. Let's be real, no one wants to watch a full four hour race at Chicagoland. I'm a huge fan and I just refuse. 
   3. Move the all\-star race to different local short tracks across the country. Pack the grand stands and let the stars battle on a bull ring for $1 mil. 
      1. Maybe even try a dirt track?
4. **Reduce cost by going ""spec"" \- i.e. IROC**
   1. Remember how amazing the old IROC races used to be? That was because every car was built in the same shop by the same people and were more or less identical. I do not want NASCAR to build all of the cars, but I want them to mandate that all teams use the same parts \- chassis, engines, transmissions, etc.. leaving \(primarily\) only the body to be modified by teams with very, very little wiggle room
      1. People way smarter than me can figure this out
   2. But what about manufacturer identity? Let's be honest here \- it does not matter. The cars on the track are nothing like road cars anymore so lets stop kidding ourselves. Put a sticker on them, woot!
   3. This will have the added benefit of really seeing who the best driver is, not who has the best equipment. *\*\*RANT: Can we just be real for a minute? There is no way that Kevin Harvick is that much better than the rest of the field week in and week out. Clearly his team \(like Truex last year\) has found something that has given him an advantage. As a fan, why would I want to watch this?\*\**
      1. At the very least I believe this should be implemented in NASCAR's lower series to really reduce cost and provide a better way for talent to rise through the ranks. No longer would $ be required to buy a ride
5. **Improve the TV broadcasts**
   1. Remove DW immediately! THIS IS NON\-NEGOTIABLE
   2. Insist that all commercials be ""side by side"" with live action so fans don't miss important moments
   3. Enforce the use of helmet cams and link them to a subscription service that allows viewers to watch this view from a VR headset. \(COULD YOU IMAGINE?!?!?!\) 
   4. Focus more on the battles happening through the field instead of only on the top 5

So those are my top ideas. Now, everyone please tear it all apart. After all, this was meant to create a discussion and promote unique ideas. I promise my feelings wont be hurt ;\)",[Long Read] My ideas to save Nascar

_____________________________________________________________________

My Take: NASCAR is down once again but this time all motorsports are down including Indycar and Formula 1. Some things to note is that despite NASCAR‚ÄôS MENCS rating and viewership being down, it was ranked practically the same as it was last season, getting beat by the same programing and still placing 1st in cable for sports during Saturday and Sunday and 1st in cable on viewership for all cable programs on Saturday.

The lowest rated race last season was the Saturday night Richmond race which took place during September. It had a 1.24 rating. Kansas has tied for that rating.

The Camping World Truck Series seemed to have had an increase in 18-49 viewership but I can‚Äôt find that data. It moved up .01 in the ratings and 25 places in the rankings despite being down 15% in overall viewers. Which means viewership is down across the board or we may have had a bump in the 18-49 viewers that I can‚Äôt see.

Indycar being down 20% in overall viewers and 26% in 18-49 viewers looks to be a big hit for them. There‚Äôs a lot of talk of Indycar actually getting more viewers and being on the rise, this shows the exact opposite of it and is looking more like NASCAR numbers. There‚Äôs a lot of factors that could be the reason for this drop, Indycar isn‚Äôt always OTA and on cable they get more around 300-400K viewers. So while the drop is huge, it might not be a huge deal because most Indycar races air on NBCSN on cable instead of OTA and 700K viewers is a lot more than the average Indycar race.

Formula 1 is down 10% from last year. The drop isn‚Äôt a big deal because they also just launched F1 TV last week so you have to figure some of that 10% drop is tuning in on that platform instead of ESPN2.

Overall it looks like motorsports viewership is down 17% in viewership from the races last year and down around 25% (not including the truck race since I don‚Äôt have the data) in 18-49 viewership.

Last week, /u/atomicpunk5150 approached the mod team with the idea of using his $50 SMI Ticket Voucher (From the NASCAR Heat 2 video game) for a giveaway on the sub. His first thought was to hold a Photoshop contest, and, let's be honest, who doesn't love a good Photoshop battle.

Over the following couple of days, we had 2 members of the mod team offer up their vouchers as well, for a total of 3 prizes.

And now for the moment you've been waiting for; the subject of today's battle. 

Your topic/subject for this contest is a feline that has become a mascot of sorts for our subreddit; raceday cannot go on without him; **Blaney the Cat.** 

/u/carsandstripes has given us their blessing to use Blaney as the subject for this contest, so much thanks to them!

TL;DR

* Photoshop contest, Blaney the cat is the subject

* Prizes include 3 $50 SMI ticket vouchers from NASCAR Heat 2 

* Contest closes at 5 PM EDT on May 16th (24 hours from now)

* I just looked at the sidebar, thank you all for helping us become 85k strong!

NASCAR,"Last week's Chicagoland race was ranked 8th in the 18-49 Demographic for cable shows last sunday drawing a .38, ranked 1st in the 50+ crowd drawing a 1.53, ranking 2nd in views drawing 2.3M viewers.

This week it's a different story and more of a negative for NASCAR. This weekend NASCAR ranked 20th in the 18-49 demo on cable drawing a .28, still ranked 1st in the 50+ demo on cable drawing a 1.42 (which may be wrong, my chart doesn't focus on the 50+ demo so another show could have beaten it but I can't see it). It ranked 3rd in viewers on cable drawing 1,992,000 viewers, only shows beating it being Fear of the Walking Dead and Rick and Morty. It being third may be inaccurate because the list doesn't rank by viewers it ranks by the 18-49 demo, but no show in the top 150 for that demo hit viewers higher than NASCAR other than the two shows I already mentioned.

The Xfinity race ranked 101 in the 18-49 demo on Cable Saturday drawing a .10. It also drew 740,000 viewers. Last week it ranked lower in the 18-49 demo on cable but it drew around 60,000 more viewers.

The Truck race wasn't ranked in the top 150 for the 18-49 demo on Cable Saturday so I can't find it's data. The previous week it ranked 147th, drawing a .06 and getting 398,000 viewers on a Friday night.

The ratings for this week's NASCAR race seem to be terrible when comparing them to the previous weeks, ranking outside the top 15 and not even drawing 2,000,000 viewers. Why that is could be a lot of different reasons, maybe they dislike the racing at New Hampshire, maybe the political stuff affected it's viewership, maybe everyone is tired of the Toyota show, whatever the reason it did do bad this weekend. It was still the number one show on NBCSN for the week, but that may change in a few weeks when hockey returns. But from looking at the data for the past year NASCAR should be doing better than regular season hockey.",NASCAR's Ratings compared to other Cable Shows this Weekend

NASCAR,"Now I don't mean in terms of performance on-track (or in bed), I mean underrated in terms of personality.

What drivers do you think don't get recognized enough for their personality? It's a universal thing that Carl Edwards and Matt DiBenedetto have very likable personalities and they have good heads on their shoulders. Ward Burton and Tony Stewart were known for having entertaining moments when they're upset, but what drivers aren't necessarily known for their personality, but should be?

I think my bet is to Martin Truex Jr. He gets hate because he dominates, but I think his personality is honestly very underrated. He's good at keeping a cool head, and he's a good sport, which is more than could be said for a good few guys over the years. Another one is probably Kyle Busch for me, since when he's not saying controversial or meme-worthy stuff he's a really nice and giving guy, and I think that gets overlooked by a lot of NASCAR's fanbase at large because of the whole crybaby thing he was/is known for.

NASCAR,[deleted],For those that like numbers....
NASCAR,"One thing I‚Äôll say about NASCAR is there are no better fans in all of professional sports. I love to tell people that. I‚Äôm a long time Gator but even going to those games, you just don‚Äôt meet the type of people you meet at races. NASCAR fans are friendly and just happy to be there. Even if you love X driver and you see me in my Jimmie gear, the ribbing is all good-natured. I‚Äôve been to all SEC stadiums and there have been times we‚Äôve left because the fans (ours or theirs) have been too obnoxious. I‚Äôve never felt that at any race I‚Äôve ever attended. I know there are people at races whose personal politics I would probably disagree with, but it never seems to be something that matters at that moment. We are all just race fans, at least for those 4-5 hours. I‚Äôd hate for the divisiveness we‚Äôve been seeing to change the sport. You be you and I‚Äôll be me, and we will just keep respecting that when we go home, we may be very different politically from another. That‚Äôs ok.

The trend isn‚Äôt perfect (Stewart‚Äôs last championship was in 2011, e.g.) and Johnson very well may win another. But with the current youth movement, it is exciting to think that this year‚Äôs winner may be a star for years to come, and may possibly become one of the greats in the sport.

NASCAR,"I'm a big NASCAR fan, one thing that we have been discussing internally is potentially sponsoring a car for a race or two. 

Obviously we aren't talking about any of the ""big 20-25 drivers"" or likely any of the big ""35"" drivers on the more well known teams, but wanted to see if anyone had some good advice on third parties that sell primary sponsorship for smaller teams looking for one off race sponsors, or even Xfinity (smaller teams) looking for primary sponsors. 

Associate sponsors would be considered potentially as well for both series. Is it best I just reach out to individual smaller teams/drivers? Or is there  some REPUTABLE middleman that can handle this.

I have a decent understanding of the budget needed, but any guidance on that wouldn't be bad as well.

One year we even went so far as to host our own site on wix.com and just uploaded an excel file each week with the new stats.  

Last year we found ""Real Time Fantasy Sports"" where it lets you pretty much create your own league from scratch which is nice, but it's a very off brand website and I don't think they'll have the new changes that nascar just put in.

 First, how early should I arrive at the track? I have read that Las Vegas is one of the worst tracks in regards to traffic and parking, so I am worried I won't make it to the track early enough to see everything. I want time to see all of the exhibits and vendors outside of the track, as well as grab a bite and pick up my scanner rental. 

Second, where is a good place to get dropped off and picked up from the track at. This will be a family vacation and only my father and I will be at the race. Where should we direct the rest of our party to drop us off and pick us up at?

Next, what kind of views should I expect from my seat. We are located in section 3P-Red. We are only a few rows above the racing surface, and although I'm excited to be close enough to feel the rumble of the engines, I am worried I won't be able to see the rest of the track. Will I have fairly decent views from my seat?

Are driver introductions and Neon Garage passes worth the $75? They seem a bit pricey, and honestly I'm not as big of a NASCAR fan as I used to be. Should I consider investing in said passes? Why or why not?

Lastly, I hear that there are always a lot of driver autograph sessions at the hotels and casinos during race weekend. Would you recommend I go to one? They sound like a lot of fun. If I can find one, how early should I arrive?

NASCAR,"So this weekend the Rusty Wallace Racing Experience was having a 70% off sale and I couldn't resist such a great deal, as I've always wanted to drive a real stock car. I'll be driving a late model at South Sound Speedway in Washington State in late August. Now being the first time I've ever driven a stock car (although I've done a ride along before at Portland International raceway-it was a blast!), I do have a few questions: First, there's one big problem I'm going to run into. I've never driven stick before. Is it easy to get the hang of? Do they teach you how to at the track, or is this something I'm going to want to learn in a friend's car a few times first? Aside from learning manual, is there anything else I should prepare for? I've climbed in an out of a stock car more than once and obviously know how to drive an automatic. Any other tips and/or to kick some ass at the track?

NASCAR,"It seems like every driver can now run a road course pretty well.  Jr finally got his first top ten at Sonoma a few years ago.  He's who I think are the ten most talented road racers.

1. Tony Stewart: This is how I knew that he didn't lose any skills.  Despite the things that happened to him he still was able to run top five at Sonoma and Watkins Glen.  Just had some bad luck that prevented some finishes.  But with five wins at the Glen and two at Sonoma, among active drivers he is in a league of his own and all time he is only two behind Gordon.  This is a great opportunity for him to win this Sunday.  What always impressed me about Tony road courses is that he has no road racing background outside of go karts.  When he ran IRL they didn't run road courses.

2. Kyle Busch.  He's the only one who is consistently winning road courses as of late. Two at Sonoma and two at the Glen.  He's won at Mexico city in Xfinity.  Like Tony, he didn't have a road racing background.  But he sure took to it.

3. Kurt Busch.  After dominating the Sonoma race in 2011 and winning you have to rank him high.  He also runs great at Watkins Glen.  He won there in Xfinity in 2006 and then was dominating the Sunday race until bad luck hit him.  

4. Jamie McMurray.  Three poles at Sonoma, could have won two, maybe three races there already.  And he's good at Watkins Glen too.  And of course, he has a 24 Hours of Daytona win.  I still remember when he started on the pole at Sonoma in 2007, was on his way to win, and then ran out of gas.  Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, and many others have all mentioned how great of a road racer he is.  If he could just have the luck.

5. Kevin Harvick.  He's just always a top five car on the road courses.  He doesn't seem to have a car that can win a lot.  But he has enough skill to finish well.

6. Martin Truex Jr.  I've always been impressed with him on these road course.  He won at Mexico city in Xfinity, he won at Sonoma in Cup, and he's great at Watkins Glen.

7. Clint Bowyer.  I knew he was good at road racing last year when he got his first top five of the season at Sonoma and could have won.  He actually hasn't done much at the Glen.  But that win of his at Sonoma back in 2012 was killer.

8. A.J Allmendinger.  The reason why I didn't rank him higher was that he missed his first two road courses races in NASCAR that he attempted.  And it really wasn't until 2011 that he became a contender on the road courses.  But now he is one of the favorites.  He's not quite as intimidating as Marcos Ambrose.  But the last two seasons he's had some of the fastest cars.

9. Jimmie Johnson.  He's good everywhere.

10. Carl Edwards.  Had that impressive win at Sonoma in 2014.  He's won at the Glen and ROA in Xfinity.  He's kind of underrated when it comes to road courses.

NASCAR,"It can't be just me, can it? It's never really not, but on this subreddit I mean.

I genuinely feel bad for Parker Kilgerman and Ryan Truex. These are two of the hardest working drivers you'll see in the garage nowadays because they know their equipment isn't top tier and they're competing against top tier equipment. Yet these boys can't catch a break.

Let's start with Parker Kligerman. He made his debut in the three main NASCAR leagues in 2009 for Penske Racing's [at the time] Nationwide team. It was at Kansas and he finished 16th. Then skip a year to 2011 where he goes fulltime until mid-year 2012 for Brad Keselowski Racing before leaving the team. During those two years he finished 11th in the points in 2011 and 5th in the points in 2012. Also noting he ran a few races with Red Horse Racing. After that he kind of faded away in the NCWTS. Mainly because then he got a ride for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NNS were he did great and finished 9th in points. In 2014 some speculated he got his big break into cup when he got a spot for Swan Racing. But after some financial difficulties and Swan Racing shut down he was rideless and faded away until 2016. In 2016 he got a ride with Ricky Benton Racing in the NCWTS. He got a third at Daytona and was the only driver by Martinsville to have all top 10 finishes. He was leading the points. Then starting at Kansas his luck just disappeared and he kept wrecking and having problems which has led him to be missing Gateway and on top of that now he can't make the chase anymore. Talk about bad luck.

Now Ryan Truex has a different story. Starting with the fact he's Martin Truex Jr's brother, he had higher expectations then someone like Parker Kligerman. He also won the 2010 K&amp;N Pro Series East championship. He made his debut in one of the top 3 NASCAR series for Diamond-Waltrip Racing's NNS team in 2010 placing 26th at Gateway. He never got huge opportunities. For example he never got a fulltime season in the NNS. But he had the opportunity to run with JGR in 2011 and 2012. Along with RPM in 2013 and BDR in 2015. In cup he got a fulltime ride for BKR but bombed it and got kicked. In 2015 he gained some recognition for racing with BDR. But his career took off again in 2016 by coming as a runner-up in the D500 in the Hattori Racing truck. He was also in the chase... Well it looked so. After good finishes but bad sponsorship problems he got replaced for a few races. Basically leaving him out of contention for a championship spot.

Why did I give these detailed biographies? Because I wanted to show why I genuinely feel bad for them. Sure they'll still make more then I'll make in a lifetime, BUT, with the talent they've shown, they just can't seem to catch a a break.",I genuinely feel bad for Ryan Truex and Parker Kilgerman

NASCAR,"ok, need some advice r/NASCAR.

I've been a Jeff Gordon ever since I can remember.  Grew up watching him, and only driver I ever really cared for.  I've been lucky to go to 3 races in my life, but unfortunately he hasn't preformed well in any of those.  I don't really plan on being a NASCAR fan much anymore once Gordon is done as there just aren't any drivers I can really get behind and I just haven't liked the direction NASCAR has gone.  

Now I live in the far western panhandle of Florida, so Homestead would be a 11-12 hour drive.  Then on top of that, I am scheduled to drive up to Ohio on that Monday for Thanksgiving.  Money is somewhat tight for me, but this is something I'd be willing to spend some coin on, so price of tickets don't concern me all that much.  It's just more of the logistics.  Part of me wants to go bed, as no matter what he does, I'm witnessing his final race, but the other part knows it really is a stupid idea to do that with me having to drive up another 14 hours north the next day.

Do you guys think it will be worth it?

Update: So I was on the verge of buying tickets, then I decided to look at hotels.  Oops, just about everything in the area is booked.  Closest is Coral Gabels at about $265 a night.  That is way too much for me.  Hotels may not cause me to go, the search will continue.

Update 2: Doesn't seem like i'm going after all. Hotels too expensive and just going to be a lot of driving.  I could still go by myself, but my dad wanted to go, and it just wouldn't feel right being down there without him.  Just a lot of other things stood in the way.  Oh well, disappointed, but will be pulling hard for JG from the couch",Should I go?

NASCAR,"For starters, you really have to take this one with a grain of salt. Actually, a ridiculously large pile of salt. Drivers simply race quite a bit different in this format than they did in the previous one. Still, it's interesting to see what the standings would look like anyway. Now the first thing you'll notice is the absence of Jeff Gordon. After Richmond, Jamie McMurray was in the top 10 in points (looking at the non-chase standings), and Carl Edwards had the wildcard. Ryan Newman finished 1 point ahead of Jeff Gordon, thereby knocking Gordon out of title contention. I'm fairly confident that I have that correct but feel free to correct me if I've made a mistake in leaving Gordon out of the pre-2014 chase grid. So without further ado, here's what it would look like after Martinsville.

1. Joey Logano: 2,274
2. Carl Edwards: 2,263, -11
3. Denny Hamlin: 2,251, -23
4. Martin Truex, Jr.: 2,250, -24
5. Ryan Newman: 2,231, -43
6. Brad Keselowski: 2,224, -50
7. Kurt Busch: 2,223, -51
8. Dale Earnhardt, Jr.: 2,221, -53
9. Kevin Harvick: 2,220, -54
10. Jamie McMurray: 2,201, -73
11. Matt Kenseth: 2,197, -77
12. Jimmie Johnson: 2,193, -81

The leader isn't particularly a surprise, but in 2nd we have a driver that has rode a wave of consistency throughout the chase. Finishes of 2nd, 5th, 15th, 6th, 8th, 5th, and 14th leave Edwards just 11 points behind Logano. 

Interestingly enough, Jimmie Johnson is completely and utterly dead last. In the chase races this year, Johnson has scored 181 points. Stenhouse, Kahne, Biffle, Larson, and Almirola have all scored more points. He's only outscored Casey Mears by 23 points. The reason? Despite having some nice results at Chicago (11th), New Hampshire (6th), Kansas (3rd), and Martinsville (12th), his 18th at Talladega and more importantly his 41st at Dover and 39th at Charlotte were the killer blows. 

Again, grain of salt here. I find it really hard to believe that Kenseth would've destroyed Logano like that under this format. But perhaps I'm wrong. ",How The Standings Would Look Under The Old Chase Format

NASCAR,"Am I ""one of you,"" the horde who stood up and cheered when Kenseth put Logano into the wall? Yes I am, and I've taken a look at why this is. 

NASCAR is talking out of both sides of its spokespersons mouths. They let their biggest puppet (Petty) condemn what happened with words like ""disgrace"" but think for a minute - when was the last time a NAPcar race was genuine Monday morning conversation? For all its willingness to go on live tv and make statements about the ""different circumstances,"" this is exactly what NASCAR needs and wants, check the replay and just LISTEN - you can't buy that kind of excitement. 

The wrecks occurred under different circumstances - take a minute and think about this. Logano spun a driver who was battling to stay in the race, effectively ending his hopes to race for a championship at Homestead. Kenseth paid back the favor, and while his retribution was admittedly more straightforward, it is a definitive example of an ""eye for an eye."" Yes, Kenseth was out of it, Logano very much in it. But once again, race me hard, I'll race you harder. 

Where is the angst and the furor over Danica Patrick purposely wrecking Gilliland? There's some great radio chatter out there transcribed to show that's exactly what she did. So where's the outrage Kyle (Petty)? How is this, at its most fundamental, ok, but what Kenseth did is disgraceful? NASCAR is treading a slippery slope, in which all are equal, yet none really are. 

Hell of a race. Exactly what the sport needs, can't wait for Texas. ","An eye for an eye, retribution, and the inequality of NASCAR"

NASCAR,,Yesterday's act of retaliation that's mostly been ignored. Danica tries to wreck Gilliland after stating her intent multiple times on the radio. He ran her up the track into the wall earlier in the race.

Congrats to Ned and the Royals! I'm sure Dale is smiling down from above!",[OT] Ned Yost and the Kansas City Royals have won the 2015 World Series
NASCAR,"To Whom It May Concern:

I am a 33 year old fan in your coveted 18-35 demographic.  I've been an avid follower since Darrell Waltrip won the 1989 Daytona 500.  I've attended races at all levels of the sport, including over 60 Cup Series events.  Through all the ups and downs, I've been there, watching, attending, and supporting.  

This sport is at a crossroads.  You believed that the traditional championship format was not working, and in 2004, ""The Chase for the Nextel Cup"" was started.  It was sold to us as a means to ""create excitement"" around the championship.  Many seats remained empty and viewership continued to decline.  Last year, it was reinvented to include elimination races, which would create more buzz, more drama, and more interest.  To some extent, it did.  The drive by Kevin Harvick to fend off elimination in Phoenix last year, and his victory at Homestead-Miami was an absolute thrill for me, but it didn't feel any different to me than when Tony Stewart won his first title in 2002 under the traditional Winston Cup format.  Harvick and Stewart are my two favorite drivers.  Needless to say, I am not a fan of The Chase in any form.  I believe every single lap should be just as important as the next.  Lap 1 of the Daytona 500 should have just as much impact on the championship as the last lap of the Ford 400.

Fast forward to this year, and the racing on the track has been stale during most races.  With a few exceptions (Darlington &amp; Martinsville come to mind), the green flag racing has been largely uneventful.  I've been tuning in to watch 3.5 hours+ of follow the leader, where the most excitement comes from pit road miscues, fuel mileage strategy, parts failures, and unfortunately, crashes.  Both races at Richmond, my favorite and home track, were downright boring.  

Now that we are in The Chase, your fabricated tight championship battle has created desperation for competitors to win, or run well enough to stay inside the ""cut line"".  When Joey Logano got into Matt Kenseth at Kansas and spun him, it was a forced elimination for the championship.  We may not have known it at the time, but we can look back today and know that's what it was.  Logano might have been able to get around him clean, but we will never know.  Logano was already locked in to the next round, and while a win is a win on any race day, that particular day, Logano won $377,000, but Kenseth may have lost over $5 Million.  

Last Sunday, you fabricated a second Green-White-Checkered attempt at Talladega after the first one didn't count because the leader didn't make it back to the start/finish line.  Your own rules stated one attempt would be made.  Whether or not they made it to the line, it was still attempted.  You ran a second attempt, and we all know what happened.  Did Kevin Harvick wreck Bayne intentionally?  I don't know.  I'm not going to defend him on that aspect of what happened.  Whether it was or wasn't intentional, it is your fault as the sanctioning body that it happened.  Here's why: 1) The second attempt should have never have occurred.  2) If there was no Chase and no elimination, Harvick would have dropped to the back and moved on to Martinsville.  Instead, he knew doing that would cost him the title and $5 Million.  No sane human being would roll over in that instance, and as a result, contact happened, intentional or not.  As a Harvick fan, I would have been angry if he pulled over before the green and conceded defeat.  We pull for our drivers because of their grit, their will to win, and their passion.  Any fan of any driver would have been heartbroken to see that happen to their driver.  I would hope every NASCAR fan would want their driver to do anything and everything to stay in the fight just as Harvick did.  That's why we love this sport.

Today at Martinsville, Kenseth took out Logano.  At Kansas, Logano eliminated Kenseth from championship contention.  Today, Kenseth may have returned the favor.  Under the traditional rules prior to 2004, it is less likely that this would eliminate Logano from championship contention.  In fact, Logan would still have a 21 point lead in the standings.  

Now there is talk of potential penalties for Kenseth.  Suspension should be off the table, because the blame for this chain of events does not rest only on the shoulders of Kenseth and Logano, it rests on yours, NASCAR's, for creating this championship format.  You fabricated this format to create excitement and drama.  This is exactly what you wanted.  Since we don't get to see it on the race track during most weeks, you try to make up for it through an elimination championship format.  Kansas, Talladega, and Martinsville occurred the way they did because of your decisions.

Penalties for Kenseth and/or Logano are not the answer.  If you want to create drama and excitement, grow the sport, and create new fans, here are my suggestions:

1) Fix The Racing.  Martinsville, Bristol, Talladega, and Daytona are exciting because the cars are close to one another.  Find a way to create close-quarters racing at all tracks.  Don't punish teams who can build fast cars, but don't make the leader untouchable.  This may involve significantly slowing the cars down.  Most of us wouldn't notice or care if the cars were going 20MPH slower if the racing product was improved.  I'd rather watch a good race run at 100MPH than a 500 mile parade at 200MPH.

2) I'm a traditionalist, but it's time to shorten the races.  Leave the Daytona 500, Coca-Cola 600, Brickyard 400, and Southern 500 alone, but besides that, all races could stand to be a little shorter.  The younger generations have shorter attention spans and don't have much interest in watching a 3.5 hour race.  In addition, a shorter race creates urgency.  If you have less time to get to the front, the more excitement you can generate.  I'm a huge fan of Sprint Car racing, and those 20-40 laps are the most hair-raising laps I've ever seen, because of the urgency.

3)  Heat Races.  If you want to keep running 400 miles at Dover, run 2 or 4 heat races of 50 laps each, then a 200 lap feature.  Run the heat races, take an hour break, then run the feature.  Fans still get to see 400 laps if they choose, and those who just want to spend 2 hours watching a race can tune in for the start of the feature.  How do you decide the starting order for the heat races?  Points.  Example: If you are doing two heat races, take the top 20 in points, split them in odd/even positions, and invert them.  19th in points starts on the pole, 1st in points starts 10th.  21st through 40th will also be split, but start straight up based on points.

4) I don't see it happening, but eliminate The Chase.  Without it, we would have quite a points battle this year between Harvick and Logano.  Sure we may have some blowouts, but they are as or more impressive than a good 10 week run.  If you insist on keeping the chase, pick a format and stick with it.  Find a way for people at the track to have a very clear picture of what is happening in real-time.  Create a smartphone app that fans at the track can access to get those stats.  In this current day of fantasy sports, many of us are used to having stats on demand.  The current NASCAR app isn't exactly the most ""user friendly"" in sports.

5) To go along with #4, make it mandatory that all race tracks provide free WiFi for their attendees.  If I can stream my home team's football game while at the race, I'm a happy man.  I can watch two events simultaneously at home, help me do it at the track.

6) Lower Ticket Prices.  I'm willing to pay $100 a ticket, but the guy I'm trying to get into the sport may not be so willing to do so.  Plus, full stands look better for people viewing on TV.  If the stands are full, it looks like the place to be.  If you sell 50,000 tickets at $100, or 100,000 at $50, you're still making the same money.  Plus, you'd make a lot more in concessions and other race day purchases.

I could go on, but I think I've said enough.  Remember, you, NASCAR, caused what has happened during this ""Chase for the Sprint Cup"".  You built the box, and the drivers are only playing in it.  You wanted drama, well you got it.  Don't punish the drivers who gave it to you.  Please consider my ideas, because I believe new and old fans will benefit, and in turn, the sport of stock car racing, and the NASCAR organization will benefit as well.

Sincerely,
Travis Galliher

I was raised in a Nascar-positive home. My parents were both huge Jeff Gordon fans, my father the more engrossed of the two. I grew up with the sport, and it was the only sport we watched for a few years. While I cheered for Gordon as well, I'd eventually switch gears to Jimmie Johnson when he was brought up. However, that is not the point of my story here.


I've continued to watch Nascar to this day, all through elementary and high school, into college and the real world, and even after moving out on my own. These races, though, were a way for my father and I to keep in touch and talk about. 


In the last year+, my dad began to have some mild stomach issues. He was convinced it was no big thing, and lived his life around it. Just recently, the issues became too much, though. After visiting the doctor, it was discovered that he was suffering from colon cancer. He'd need surgery immediately to remove a portion of his colon, and he'd be placed on a temporary colostomy bag. 


Fortunately, the surgery went well, and the worry we had began to diminish. After ~5 days in the hospital, my dad would return home. While he had very little mobility, it was great to see him back home. He was back in time for the Dover race (the one in which we were both disappointed to see Jimmie eliminated, but still had Gordon to root for). Charlotte passed as well, and with that week of recovery, he improved drastically.


That Wednesday, I came home from work around 3:30pm. Not 30 minutes later, I received a call from my aunt. At a checkup with his oncologist, my dad was going to be suffering from Fournier Gangrene. For those who are not familiar with the disease (I was not), it is quite a deadly illness. Patients can die quickly if not treated for it, and it is often found in diabetics (which my father is). He'd need immediate surgery, and was rushed from the oncologist to another hospital. The doctor later told us that, had my dad gone home that night, death was nearly imminent. 


Fast forward more than two weeks, and my dad remains hospitalized. He's been under heavy pain medications, and has not been able to talk or communicate. He's missed the last few races, and I can think of nothing but him while I watch them now. 


With Gordon's win, we all know he will be one of four contender's for the title. Ever since I became a Jimmie fan, my dad has slowly become one, too. I feel like that's mainly because he saw me rooting for him, because that is the kind of father he is, but in the back of my head, I know he's still a Gordon diehard all the way. 


When Gordon announced this was his final season, my dad did not show much emotion. However, I firmly believe it had a significant impact on him. Gordon was practically the only driver he ever watched, and this was going to be a big hit for him. 


Now, I have no idea when he will be back home. This infection has, quite literally, ripped him apart, and has pushed off chemotherapy and radiation for a significant amount of time. It's looking more and more likely I'll be watching the Homestead race in the hospital room with he and the rest of my family. 


I think I've lost track of the main point of this post. It's been mainly been a way of getting this all off my chest, and to anyone that's been reading this entire post, I cannot thank you enough. I just hope that, if you do not have a driver you're rooting for at this point in the Chase, you'll root for Jeff Gordon. I know I will be, right next to one of his biggest fans, my father.


Edit: Of course, this post was in no way made to earn gold. However, I am eternally grateful that someone would sacrifice their hard earned money to do so. Thank you, fellow Nascar fan.","A Story, If I May"

International Raceway:

Are you shifting here at Phoenix?

""I wish NASCAR would really come up with a ban on that. There is no reason why we should be shifting on a one-mile race track. This is a short track, not a road course. Make the gearing so we cannot shift because it's just dumb for us to have the option to be able to shift. Everything that they're trying to do with the whole gear rule and less horsepower, it throws that all out the window when you're able to go out here and shift. It will be an option and people will try to do it. I'm sure late in the runs it will be effective, but it's just with the gear taken out and the horsepower, we're just lugging off these corners and you're just flat footing it. As a driver, it's tough to be able to race that way so we're having to shift to try to get up off the corner. Hopefully looking forward we can change it to where you don't have to do that.""


If other drivers shift, are you forced to shift?


""I think on restarts most everyone will shift when you're all bottled up. I think people will be successful both ways, but it's just that option. Come one, we're on a short track, why are we shifting?""(Toyota Racing)(3-14-2015)",Hamlin complaining about shifting at Phoenix: thoughts?

NASCAR,"Matt is a guy I kind of latched onto when he started with the Gibbs organization. Since then, it has been kind of a hard road for him. Gibbs was focusing more on Cup drivers in Xfinity at the time, so he got relegated to being a test driver while moving back to K&amp;N for a year. He then kinda disappeared for a while, sporadically S&amp;Ping for TMG, finally ending up with a Xfinity ride as a teammate to Tanner Berryhill in 2013. But this was just a start and park role for the most part. 

Last year, it was back to TMG in their start and park car. However, he did get a few chances in the main car that raced the whole race- and finished 11th at Elkhart Lake. He ended up racing the final 14 races in the main TMG car, the closest thing he has had to a steady ride in NASCAR. 

It is very exciting to see someone like Matt make the race after going home twice and really looking weak in those races. He timed in. When you follow a driver like Matt, having him make a Cup race on time gives you a feeling sometimes stronger than having one of your top drivers actually winning a race. 

You can follow Matt on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mattdracing

NASCAR,"Being the only NASCAR fan you know can carry a bit of a stigma. People are quick to condescend, considering that to them, the uninitiated, you're a fan that follows a sport that somewhat appeals to the lowest denominator.

Not saying that's the case with every non fan. But I was one of those fans who withheld his NASCAR fandom unless I got to really know someone. Stigmas suck, as do condescending people. Therefore, I kept my fandom on the DL. My own wife didn't know I was a fan until after we dated awhile.

I know it's hypocritical to operate under an assumption, and I guess I was assuming as such without thinking about it because when I read about some of you yesterday I felt more at ease about being a fan. I mean, I already gathered that you were the smartest NASCAR fans around (drivers who frequently lurk here, that's no joke), but to see that some of you were like me or seemed like people I'd hang with, it did me some good.

So, screw the TL;DR. You guys are awesome and you should feel awesome because everything is awesome here at /r/NASCAR.","Nothing to contribute, but I just wanted to say thank you to the fine folks of /r/NASCAR..."
NASCAR,"Hi everyone,

I bought season tickets to Auto Club Speedway this year, and unbeknownst to be they come with a garage tour on Friday afternoon, Saturday morning before the Xfinity race, or Sunday before the cup race. What time do you guys think would be the best for me to actually see and possibly meet some of the drivers?

Also, I realize there's a Track Talk Tuesday thread and I would normally post in there, but I have to submit my time by the 15th. 

Thanks!",Auto Club Speedway Advice
NASCAR,"Harvick has now finished in position 1 or 2 for six consecutive races, and it very well may be seven on Sunday. My question is - when's the last time a driver finished 1/2 for seven consecutive times? Has it ever happened in the modern era? I'm expecting something like Jimmie Johnson or Jeff Gordon to be the answer, but I'm not sure as to when/if it's ever happened.",Simple question about Harvick's streak of high finishes.

formula1,"Can someone explain how supplying parts for other F1 teams works?

Specifically:

1. With Williams buying engines from Mercedes, do they receive the same engine that Mercedes is running that season?

2. Once Williams receives the engine is it up too them to upgrade/tweak what it‚Äôs capable of? Or will Mercedes provide assistance through the season as they also upgrade their engine?

3. Have Racing Point essentially purchased a fully engineered Mercedes car to run in their team? What version of the Mercedes F1 car did they purchase? Last years model? This years? A combination of the two? 

4. With Williams struggling to develop a car that is competitive and Racing Point seemingly being able to put out a mid-field level car with what seems like minimal engineering, it begs the question of why Williams doesn‚Äôt mirror what Racing Point have done and have more of a ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù style of development where they get large portions of their car designed by Mercedes. Do they have more engineering capabilities than Racing Point? Is it more viable to develop your own car like they are rather than buy more parts from different manufacturers?

5. How much of Williams‚Äô car is designed by them and how much is outsourced/purchased from manufacturers? And in turn how much development does Racing Point do with theirs?

6. Is the same team that designs/produces the Mercedes teams power unit also the team that supplies Williams and Racing Point?

formula1,So you probably think that a unsafe release or something like that that is the teams fault or the team did something wrong but the driver gets penalties let me introduce team time penalty‚Äôs it doesn‚Äôt affect the driver so let‚Äôs say it a unsafe release 100% the teams fault then you would give a team time penalty if one is given the driver will not have time added to there time and they will get the points of the finishing position but the team will get a time penalty for that car it will only affect the constructors championship let‚Äôs say someone has a unsafe release they can get a 5 second team time penalty I finish first and I would keep the points for the drivers championship but there is a car 3 seconds behind me the team will get a 5 second time penalty and so for the constructors the team gets the points for second. I think this is a good idea because it will not penalise the driver for mistakes made by the team. tell me what you think of this In the comments,A idea for penalties in f1

And with Mercedes finally showing some cracks in the way of apparent engine reliability we could‚Äôve finally seen someone give them a real challenge.

Not to mention completely missing out on the start of season scramble to develop a DAS steering system to rival Mercedes, or if the system itself even yields advantages in the first place.

Oh yeah not to mention getting too see the first race on the newly rebuilt Zandvoort, with a sea of drunken Dutch fans dressed head to toe in orange screaming incoherently at Max as he passes them every lap.

I just wish Corona could‚Äôve held off for a few more months, I really wanted too see the chaos that was going to be this season.

In GP3 each team races 3 cars per round, and the only time she outscored a team mate was in 2017 and 2018. 

In 2017 outscored Bruno Baptista (that participated in all rounds like her, so fairplay there) and Santino Ferruci (that only participated in the first 3 rounds of the season).

In 2018 she outscored Jannes Fittje, who participated in 5 rounds (1/2 of the season) and scored 0 points.

I am a fairly new F1 fan, and from what I gather, one of the big issues with cars right now, is that cars lose a lot of downforce if they are tailing another car. 

If that is the issue, wouldn't it be better/easier instead of forcing multiple design restrictions on the teams on front wings, back wings, bodywork etc, to instead just implement an overall downforce reduction limit?

What do I mean by that? The teams design their car and put two in the wind tunnel, one behind the other. Does the car in the back have at least 90%(arbitrary number) of the downforce that the front car does? Your design is legal. Does it not? Go back to the drawing board.

If the issue is downforce, why not create a specific test just for that?

formula1,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about Ocon claiming he isn‚Äôt very good or is midfield at best, and wanted to look through his results to clarify his level. His previous seasons are below:

2018 Force India, Age 21

Teammate: Sergio Perez

Qualifying: 16/5, Ocon

2 car finishes: 9/5, Ocon

Points: 62/49, Perez

Laps ahead: 610/411, Ocon

‚Äî‚Äî

2017 Force India, Age 20

Teammate: Perez

Qualifying: 12/7, Perez

2 car finishes: 10/6, Perez

Points: 94/83, Perez

Laps ahead: 706/396, Perez



Based on the data, Ocon was the better driver in 2018 compared to Perez, all at the age of 21. The same Perez who‚Äôs considered one of the best midfield drivers and a great Sunday driver. Given his trajectory and how young he is, Ocon could very well be a championship caliber driver. This is especially true given he had a run of 27 consecutive races without a DNF (Oconsistency). The scrap with Max in Brazil really turned the tide of public opinion against Esteban, but he is one of the better drivers on the grid with quite a high ceiling considering his age (now 22)",Just How Good is Esteban Ocon?

formula1,"Just read about the latest silly season rumor going around that Renault will likely sign Ocon and act as the wastebasket for Mercedes' love triangle (the source is Bild, though, so... make of that what you will), and - though, for the record, I don't really think getting rid of Hulkenberg is all that neccessary, anyway - I'm now wondering if it would be wiser for them to pick up Bottas instead, if they do decide to release Hulk.

Main reason for this is, given Renault's current position as a team, Bottas' experience would prove invaluable, specifically his experience and knowledge on how Mercedes operates. The way the team strategize for each race, their runs in practice, their philosophy on how they built and develop their cars, I'm sure Bottas would have some basic knowledge and understanding of these things - more so than Ocon, at least. The sort of input he could have could prove really crucial for the team, as we get ever closer to the 2021 reboot.

I remembered back in Prost's Beyond The Grid interview, he said one of the most important things Ricciardo would bring into the team is his knowledge of how a winning team works - in his case, Red Bull - and that, with that knowledge, he can be someone the team can learn from, and to be frank, based on their performances, this year, Renault do seem like they need the lecture. No better available driver to bring that sort of quality into the team than the guy who's spent 3 seasons with an all-conquering monster of a racing institution.

He's probably a better fit, personality-wise, too. Seems like Bottas has a cooler head than Ocon and a less abrasive personality from what I've seen. Has less to prove, would drive more sensibly when needed, and looks to be more receptive to team orders. Though this isn't to discredit Ocon - I think it's fantastic that he's got a wild side - but, again, considering Renault's current predicament, I don't think they can afford to manage any form of teammate beef.

Plus, imagine the chad frat bro who sings song about his own scrotum doing corny PR shit with the bicentennial man himself. That's a link-up I didn't know I needed to see happen before I thought about it.

Quality-wise, he's definitely up there. Might be an unpopular opinion around here, but I reckon he's a slight step up on Hulkenberg, at this point. Certainly not going to be any slower. And if it's age that Renault's worried about then, well, he's already younger than Hulkenberg, surprisingly enough, and they already have some young drivers in their books anyways, like Hubert, Zhou(?), and de Vries(?), so they can always just use Bottas as a stop gap if youth is really that important.

Unless it turns out that it's Mercedes who are offering Ocon to Renault and they haven't got anything to say about it, then this whole discussion would be pointless, but if Renault are the ones who are actively trying to sign one of the drivers - with Mercedes being the passive party in the whole deal, making both drivers available, happy to have either driver, happy listen to any offers for the other - then I reckon they should try to sign Bottas instead.

Now that I've mentioned it, I think the former situation might be more likely :/

I don't know. I think Bottas to Renault makes a whole lotta sense... What do you think?",Shouldn't Renault pick Bottas instead of Ocon?

The problem with the cars of the last few years is they disrupt the flow of air for cars behind, making following a car closely difficult because there was a reduction in downforce generated by the chasing car.

However in turn, would this mean that slip stream is more effective over the last few years? With the wake of the leading car going back as far as 5 seconds some say.

I understand that the change will help overtaking as cars will be closer and allow for overtakes in places they normally couldn't due to shorter gaps. However could a consequence of this be that following cars will not gain as much from a slipstream/tow as before?

Could lead to some instances where let's say you are 8 tenths behind on a long straight, this year the slipstream will be strong enough to allow an overtaking opportunity, but with the rule change it may not.",Will cleaning up airflow reduce slipstream?

I own a few of the F1 season reviews on Blu Ray / DVD.

In the pics I will link to you will see a genuine 2014 Review on blu ray I purchased in a store on the left, on the right is the one I think may be pirated.

I contacted the seller on eBay and they just assured me it was genuine.

If anyone else owns this and could show me a pic of how your disc / slip cover looks I would really appreciate it, thank you.

A few years ago Bernie realised what we‚Äôve all known for some time, the qualifying format wasn‚Äôt really working. There followed some good &amp; some not so good adjustments to the format, but to my mind the problem persists.
I‚Äôve had this concept rattling round my head for sometime and wanted to run it past you guys. 
The new format would basically consist of the following 2 sessions:

Q1
This would be an inter team battle where the teammate with the quickest time would go through to Q2. The slower team mate would be placed in the last 11 places of the grid, the position would be set by the time differential to their teammate. So if for example Hamilton was 0.1s behind Botas and Vandorn was 0.09s behind Alonso, then Vandorn would start ahead of Hamilton.

Q2
This would be a straight out the faster the lap the higher up the grid you are session.

I think this format would create a really interesting &amp; exciting qualy from start to finish &amp; have the added bonus of really spicing up the race with a lot of overtakes. Please let me know what you think.",Feedback on an idea for a new qualy format.

formula1,If so how many sets per driver/team?,Is there a limit on the number of tire sets used by teams/drivers during testing?
formula1,"It seems like the teams and the fans of F1 all dislike the fact that the teams are limited to 3 engines per year. I am curious what r/formula1 thinks could be done about this to make a better system.

I think that a 'luxury tax' system might work well. Using the constructors championship, the higher placed teams would need to pay a fee for any extra engine they use, which would be distributed to all the teams from 4\-10. For example, if Seb used a 4th engine, they need to pay 100,000 to each team from 4\-10 in the constructors championship.

The team last in the constructors would get unlimited free engines. Being last place, this would help them be more competitive, but also they are not likely to use many engines, since they have a much lower budget then the other teams anyway. 

Do you think we could ever see something like this? What would you suggest instead?",Ways around the engine limit.

formula1,I've seen it in both day and night time circuits. Thanks,What does the flashing red light on the back of a Formula 1 car mean?
formula1,,"Beautiful cars, beautiful sounds. 1962 Monaco GP."
formula1,"Grosjean has been getting a lot of flack lately for underperforming. (And yes he has). The move he pulled in Spain was dangerous and I am not surprised by the penalty. Should it be a race ban? Probably not. Put a penalty yes. The thing with Haas F1 is that they don‚Äôt care about Grosjean pre 2016. When they signed Grosjean for the 2016 season they already knew what type of driver he was and he showed them with a fantastic 6th place in Australia. He ended up finishing the first season strong while Gutierrez did not score a single point. Grosjean did crash the car on the way to the grid in Brazil but other than that the season was pretty strong. 

Come 2017 he continued the points haul. Magnussen stepped in as well yet he was still seen as a strong driver. By the end of 2017 Haas F1s car was not receiving upgrades unlike Renault and Torro Rosso and they slipped behind. While Grosjean failed to score points, so too did Magnussen. 

This 2018 season has been dismal. However barring the Spanish incident Grosjean is doing ok. In Australia he was in 5th before the pit stop failure. I‚Äôm Baku he raced a nearly perfect race! (Before then screwing it up). Grosjean is not as poor a driver as his results dictate. 

With Steiner behind him, Grosjean clearly likes Haas. He has grown up with the team for better and worse and simply tossing him away would be a disservice to how Grosjean has helped the team develop. The team certainly wouldn‚Äôt be a top midfield team if it weren‚Äôt for him.

As such, even with the 0pts this season. Grosjean will be back next year. He still has 16 races to get points and right the ship. Obviously he has pressure and if he doesn‚Äôt score soon he may indeed be out. But I cannot see him simply being tossed away mid season or at the end of the year. All Grosjean needs is a clean race. A 10th place finish. Something to get his confidence back. If Haas has a fast car in Monaco, he could indeed do that even with the 3 place grid penalty.

To those that mention 2012, Haas doesn‚Äôt care
To those that say he will be gone next year, give it a few more races
To those that think Grosjean is awful. Just remember we were just criticizing Magnussen and now it seems people are supporting him? 

Grosjean is important to Haas F1 and he cares about Haas. He will likely right the ship and be fine by the end of the year. Just give him a few more races and then decide. We are less than 1/4 of the way through the season. ",In defense of Romain Grosjean (and why he will still be at Haas)

That does not mean they hate Ferrari, but I will not have been shocked if there is a bias lurking. And the recent tyre debacle doesn't meen that FIA/Pirelli are trying to hurt Ferrari- BUT they know Merc car places premium on the harder tyres, and Ferrari said that the tyre change would hurt them before testing.

formula1,,This week on the F1 Report |
formula1,"Before I receive hate, please remember this is a personal opinion and I would be especially excited to hear your own point of view as well. 

If Toro Rosso really seemingly have given up on Kvyat and are only keeping him because they don't really have any other ""realistic"" options, I have a stupid, crazy solution that in reality could possible make sense. Other than who will be in the Williams seat next year, another burning question is where Pascal Wehrlein will end up, DTM (again), FE, or simply just a reserve driver role. Honestly, even though Pascal is a Mercedes Junior Driver and RB and Merc don't seem to be the best of friends especially since Merc refused to give RB engines, Pascal would be a way better option than Kvyat. Toto has already pulled something similar by getting Pascal into a team with a Ferrari engine (although it is a year old). Although I would imagine Dr. Marko laughing out of the room at this proposal, it truly does make sense. I don't think that Pascal deserves to be pushed out of the sport (at least temporarily), especially under the circumstances he is in (opposition from Sauber owners and Ferrari trying to establish a ""junior"" team. I also don't think that Honda would be very keen on bringing in a Mercedes junior, but I see this deal as benefiting all parties involved. 

P.S. I really would like to see your guys' take on this thought, it is extremely crazy with a 0% chance, but I really do think it would be beneficial for both Pascal's career and Toro Rosso/Honda.","Wild, Crazy Thought"

Well, I was looking for another video and ran across [this onboard video comparing his lap 5 when all gears were working vs lap 70 when he only had 6th gear](https://youtu.be/jCZwlGdAdAM).  It blew my mind seeing how smooth and fast he drives with just 6th gear and wanted to share.  

I know Schumacher finished P2 for the 94 Spanish GP with only 5th gear, and I don't want to take anything from that, but to see these drivers tame a F1 car with only ONE gear is nothing but amazing.  Not to mention Senna was driving in a peaky brand new Honda V12 engine that was rumored to have sacrificed low-end power and still had a H-pattern gearbox.

If you don't know the story behind this grand prix, here's a [good 1 min video](https://youtu.be/CVSgOIAOW7g) that summarizes it.  It's good to see a happy Ron Dennis again.  

PS:  I came across this 91 Brazil onboard looking for his 1988 Monaco GP qualifying but does anyone know if it even exists?  I've been looking for years and they all seem to be mis-titled as 1988.  If anyone has it, please do share.",Senna 91 Brazil GP onboard video - comparing lap 5 with a working gearbox vs lap 70 with just 6th gear

If you have an Android phone and use Reddit is Fun I just figured out a cool way to automatically set my wallpaper to the newest post in /r/F1Porn. 


Download the free app - IFTTT  (If This Then That) - from the Play Store.  


From there you can set up a vast amount of 'recipes' where if something happens you can command your phone or another app to do something.   


Unfortunately it won't let me share the recipe link but it's very simple to set up!  


Create a new recipe and choose Reddit for the 'if', then choose 'any new post in subreddit' as the trigger.  


It will then ask for a subreddit. I used F1Porn (it does seem to be case-sensitive).  


After that, click on 'Device' for then and 'update device wallpaper' as the action. It will pop up and say 'imageURL', just click OK and you're all set!

formula1,"I'm sure this has been discussed a lot, but frankly I need a day to cool off before coming to this subreddit.  I'm a huge F1 fan, have been to races, and have been watching since I was a little kid (38 now).  I've also been a MotoGP fan for about 18-20 years, but have not followed it as passionately until about 2-3 years ago.

It's really painful to watch our sport get constantly screwed up, something we talk a lot about here.  I just can't understand why they say it's all about the teams, yet make things like the radio bans.  They always veil their changes with total BS like ""it's confusing for the fans"" and stuff like that, stuff that makes zero sense.  In F1 if you touch a cone, or do this on that line, you get a penalty or something.  I really do get that stuff, it's for safety, but it all takes away from what fans really want to see, racing.  In MotoGP, I'll see guys exit the pit lane and go around the cones at the exit because there was a guy in the way, and nobody even bats an eye.  In F1 I'm constantly worrying if someone I like will mess up and not do the secret handshake correctly, and get penalized.  It's absurd.  We want to watch the fastest drivers get in the fastest cars, and go as fast as possible, period.

It's becoming increasingly difficult to continue being a fan of F1.  I never thought I'd say that MotoGP is my favorite thing to watch, but right now it's leaps and bounds better than F1, and that is painful to say.  I hope it's Bernie, and when he's gone (he has to die sometime), maybe things will turn around.","F1 is supposed to be a team sport, they beat that into our heads, then why do they keep making it seem like it's a driver/individual sport?"

However, in the last few months i started noticing that every unpopulair opinions people make gets downvoted like crazy cause people simply don't agree.

This is not what the mod system/voting system is for.
Lately, it seems to me that every unpopulair opinion gets downvoted and eventually gets hidden, not because of trolling or anything bad but just because people dont share the same opinion.  
This is a discussion forum for fuck sake, everyone's opinion should be respected even though you have different thoughts.  
Even the mods dont give any shit about all this.

This really makes this sub getting worse and worse, its all follow the mass opinion and every other thought is irrelevant. I really expect people here to be grown up and respect others opinions, and eventually discuss it.  I can link a shitload of examples but i cant even be bothered right now.  
The quallity of this sub really goes down this way.

If we all just simply care about mainstream opinions then we can also just close all threads for replying and make it a news only sub.
I also really hope the mods actually take some actions about this.

Its not that i am talking about my own experiences, but just reading through the replies that it really starts to annoy me.  
For example, if there is a thread about Bottas and the masses praise him then making a well build reply why you think he is average or overrated, it gets downvoted like hell cause well people follow the masses. Everything positive gets upvoted like crazy.  
This makes me, and im sure others aswell, not even longer caring to discuss stuff.

**EDIT 1**: *Fantastic support so far guys, more than I imagined. You are actually making a visible difference to my percentage after less than an hour - thanks so much!* 

**EDIT 2**: Mind Blown. I had a 2.5% share of the votes this morning and now we are up to 10.5% - Considering there have been thousands of votes for the others so far, that is a huge dent into the totals. I am overwhelmed by this support - hard to believe it's actually happening. Thanks for keeping the dream alive...

**EDIT 3**: 6 Hours in and we have gone from 2.6% to 14% - INCREDIBLE. The power of you guys and this sub is nuts. Even if I don't make it, this has been amazing to be part of.. and for those interested you can follow my career progress on my racing page here: [Des Foley Racing](https://www.facebook.com/desfoleyracing) More to follow later!

**EDIT 4**: 8 Hours in - we made the undercut work and are into P2! Need to keep the momentum up. P1 is just a few percent up the road. Keep pushing guys, you are the real heroes here!

**EDIT 5**: 13 Hours in - DRS activated and we are into P1. The Honda never stood a chance. We've got to make these primes last another 3-4 days now, but to come from that far back in the first place is nothing short of astounding. You guys are the true definition of an online community and I hope I can keep sharing my journey with as much as possible in the years to come. For now, I've gotta get some sleep soon, let's hope we've still got a few tenths in the morning!

**EDIT 6**: 24 hours on from the original post - Currently in the lead by 1.3% - A big thanks to the mods for stickying the post - so generous. Based on the referral link and some calculations, I'm leading by around 150 votes. That's not much at all, but I imagine things will slow down a lot for everyone now as we've all used up so many resources. If any of you have more ideas PM me, I'm here all day!

**EDIT 7**: Things have really slowed down as expected, but the guy in 3rd place is making huge ground and has gotten over a hundred votes in the last hour. I'm pretty sure that this is going to go down to the wire and be a 3 horse race. If anyone that reads this edit can message one person and get them to vote that could make the world of difference. 

**EDIT 8**: Box box box. We are about to lose P1. This is one hell of a battle guys, but now we need someones quick thinking to bounce back for the final stretch. Current standings as of 17:45pm UK - 21.5% Des - 21.4% Bradley -17.5% Jamie

**EDIT 9**: We all got hundreds of votes this evening and pretty much matched each other. Charlie was the biggest gainer, while Jamie dropped off a bit in the end. Votes as of 00:31 UK - 21.6% Bradley - 21.5% Des -17.3% Charlie

**EDIT 10**: Over 20,000 Votes have been cast so far. Everyone is pulling out all the stops - this is how we stand as of 2pm on Wednesday http://i.imgur.com/jGVMyw9.jpg","I‚Äôve been given the chance to compete with my F1 heroes Vettel &amp; H√ºlkenberg at Race of Champions in a few weeks, but now I need you guys to help make it a reality..."

formula1,"To begin with, i think that Valtteri Bottas is a brilliant driver and he totally deserves to be in his position.

He shows good pace and consistency throughout the season.

The thing is that he seems not to be able to become the top driver that most people thought he could be.

In 2015 he is nowhere near Vettel, having nearly half his points.

The fact that he is on par with Kimi who is too inconsistent and underperforming for the most part of the year is not what would be expected of him.

But his main problem is that he is not able to majorly outscore his teammate Massa, who is at the end of his career and without incentives.

Williams did not help him a lot with the car in 2015, not being able to close the difference with the Mercs that was established in 2014.

It is important to distinguish himself from the other drivers in 2016 if he wants to get a hotter seat for 2017. 2015 seems to have been a small setback in his career in my opinion.

formula1,"When you look when Ricciardo crashes into him on lap 1 [here](http://imgur.com/lSZ80sh). Notice he hits right on Vettel's right rear wheel? 

Now this could do any number of things. Even slight suspension arm damage could result in a slightly bent track of the car, which would heavily reduce the braking capacities and cause one wheel to lock.

From that point on Vettel had car instability, his first spin following that he lost the rear end, you can see that [here](http://imgur.com/59Ar98Y) and [here](http://imgur.com/Nrfn4RO). This would be typical of bent steering or brake issues at the wheel Ricciardo damaged.

[Opposite lock showing rear instability.
](http://imgur.com/4yFESAJ)

Now all this to me points pretty decisively to damage from that contact. There is just no way a driver of Vettel's class could make so many errors in one race, he's a 4x champion. I think he was being modest in blaming himself like a true team player, but the car actually had damage from Ricciardo.

formula1,"People have been saying this for a few years now, but this year I finally sense that the end of F1 as the glorious pinnacle of motorsports is nigh. 

To me, the biggest issue is that Mercedes have a considerable power advantage over their rivals. Ferrari in the early-mid 2000's and Red Bull in the early 2010's had a distinct advantage mainly due to their superior aero package, not due to engine superiority. And, given the regulations, the engine deficit will be extremely hard to close. 

Also, neither Ferrari nor Red Bull in their heyday had as big an advantage (in % terms) as Mercedes seem to be enjoying now. 

Sure, some folks will point out that Williams, Lotus and Force India all have Mercedes engines. But don't forget, none of these teams really can be considered front runners. Given a level playing field, they'd be solid midfielders at best. By my reckoning, Ferrari engines are about 5 - 8 tenths behind the Mercs, and Renault about a further 5 - 8 tenths behind. Honda engines are perhaps a full 3 seconds behind Mercedes (though with much more headroom to unlock). 

I think this time the FOM/FIA seriously fucked up. Unless drastic recovery measures are taken (which will inevitably be at the detriment of Mercedes and Williams), Formula 1 can bid good bye and will be on a permanently downward trajectory into oblivion.

formula1,"There have been plenty of swirling rumours about Audi buying Red Bull and it occurred to me that if Audi do join we may witness the second round of one of the great motorsport rivalries of all time.

The European Championship was series contested 1931-32, 35-39 and was dominated by two teams Mercedes Benz (the Silver Arrows) and Auto Union (who later became Audi) with Alfa Romeo playing a cameo role in the early championships.

It was one of the greatest engineering arms races in history and both companies produced spectacular cars to display German engineering power on the Grand Epreuve circuit.

Any potential revival of this would be incredibly exciting and really push the boundaries of speed. If both flexed their industrial muscles in a punch up then there will be quite a firework show!",Silver Arrows vs Auto Union - Round 2?

Probably a long shot that this would even be considered but what do you think could this work?",I've just had a thought about increasing the calender size

Article is in Finnish but here's the most imporant points.

&gt; ‚Äì Menin sinne ennen kaikkea rauhoitellakseni heit√§, koska en halunnut heid√§n panikoivan, Arrivabene kertoi F1-Technical-sivuston mukaan.

 - I went there mainly to calm them down because I didn't want them to panic, Arrivabene said according to F1-Techinical's page.

&gt; ‚Äì Toiseksi halusin kysy√§ mekaanikoilta mit√§ tapahtui, ja voisivatko he selitt√§√§ tapahtuneen minulle. Yksinkertaisesti sanoin h√§nelle ‚Äùrauhoitu, keskity, √§l√§ huoli‚Äù.

 - Secondly, I wanted to ask the mechanic what happened and if he could tell me what happened. I just simply said ""calm down, focus, don't worry.""

formula1,"After Melbourne, I am starting to think the 2015 tires are a little bit too conservative.  
Honestly I liked 2012 and 2013 with tires drama at every race, it was nice, maybe too much at the beginning of the season but still a very enjoyable show.  
This year looks like the tires are not an issue and this means less overtakes, less pit stops and basically a same/similar strategy for everyone.

formula1,"So, after watching the race, reading lots of reactions and seeing Red Bull slamming Renault (again), I think I've misunderstood the engine token system as it's been explained to me.

**What I thought:**
The engine is homologated at the start of the season. Because of a loophole in the rules, that homologation could happen later in the season, but until then teams would run the 2014 engine instead. Upgrades are only allowed on safety, reliability or cost-saving. Tokens allow upgrading of engine between seasons only.

**What I now think it might be:**
Engines can be upgraded with these tokens throughout the season. Once all tokens are used, that's it and only safety, reliability or cost-saving upgrades can be made. Tokens can be used on any engine that hasn't already been used. So the engine that did the race today can not be upgraded, but further units can be.

Is this right? Can we expect the engines to be upgraded as the season goes on, or will it solely be engine mappings and control systems that can be upgraded and these tokens are being held for the winter when the 2016 engine will benefit from the upgrades.

Thanks.",ELI5: Engine Upgrade Tokens
